** Setup
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package org-auto-clock
    :after org
    :commands org-auto-clock-mode
    :straight (:type git :host github :repo "justinbarclay/org-auto-clock")
    :init
    (org-auto-clock-mode)
    :custom
    (org-auto-clock-projects '("org-clock-auto" "some-other-project"))
    ;; Defaults to using project.el to determine project name
    (org-auto-clock-project-name-function #'projectile-project-name))
#+end_src
** How does it work?
=org-auto-clock= will clock you in to your tasks defined within your =org-agenda-files= if it detects that the current project name is defined with the =alist= =org-auto-clock-projects=. It defaults to determining project name by using the facilities provided by =project.el=, but can be changed to use =projectile's= =projectile-project-name=. It can also be paired with a custom function that will return a string that can be compared with the values in =org-auto-clock-projects=.
